	Annote = {This paper is about a question answering service for blind people that uses Mechanical Turk along with some AI techniques like speech recognition and computer vision.  To me, this work mostly made a case for the fact that there's a great need for cameras to assist blind people in taking photographs.  The usefulness of the app was severely limited by the poor photos that the blind people often took.  I was disappointed that the authors didn't try a more iterative model where the Turkers could look at the photo and provide cues to the blind person about how they could take a more useful one.  I was also surprised that the authors didn't try to verify the responses.  I understand that latency was a key concern, but surely providing incorrect/spammy answers back to the blind person is less desirable than providing an answer in which you have more confidence after some small delay?  In the AMP Lab, one of our goals is to develop "error bars on everything."  One way to balance the need for reliability with the need for real-time performance is to provide the answers as quickly as they come back but to also tag each answer with an error bar.  As more answers are received, you can adapt the answer and reduce the error bar, indicating that your confidence has increased.  I was a bit confused by the authors' explanation of how they maintained a worker pool -- it sounded like they were just keeping the workers busy answering questions to which they no longer needed an answer just to keep them around.  Surely there must be a better way to keep the workers engaged?  Maybe they could have a separate "low priority" service which costs less and whose tasks will only be given to workers when they are idle.  I was intrigued by their comments about how a pool of workers could be shared among many users of VizWiz.  As I believe that the crowd and the cloud have a lot of parallels, this reminds me of Heroku, which hosts Ruby on Rails apps on EC2.  Heroku minimizes their costs by multiplexing many users on the same pool of EC2 instances.  You could also imagine a scaling service for the VizWiz crowd that would adapt the size of the worker pool to the VizWiz demand.},

This is a great paper, since it is a nice application of crowdsourcing that also touches on some interesting research issues, such as (1) hybrid computer-human systems, (2) time to answer vs. cost/quality, (3) the need for guidance on how to set costs, # of workers per stage, etc.  I'm interested in exploring some of these issues.  I was very impressed by how the authors were able to produce useful results from unreliable Turker output.  The theme of producing reliable results from noisy input/unreliable components is a strong theme in distributed systems, and I'm happy to see it here as well.  I like the Find-Fix-Verify pattern, but I wish the authors would have done more to explain which existing patterns are similar and also why they are lacking.  This seems an important omission in the related work since the authors claim that the pattern is one of their main contributions.  I also wish the authors would have provided more discussion of why they chose various constants mentioned throughout the paper (eg, price paid to workers at each of the FFV stages, number of workers per stage).

The Quinn et al. paper zoomed out, focusing not just on MTurk but on a wide range of systems/projects that involve people and arguing for a taxonomy of all such efforts.  The authors first argue for the boundaries of human computation, stating that the key feature is that a person initiates a task, and some combination of computers and people respond to the task.  These boundaries were probably the most interesting/thought-provoking part of the paper for me.  I agree that having a sense for the scope of the field is important, but I didn't immediately agree with all their boundary decisions.  For example, Wikipedia seems to be a tricky case, since while sometimes people do indeed decide which articles to create (as the authors state), other times, Wikipedia users can request an article.  In that case, the system does seem to fall within the umbrella of human computation.  I guess this brings up a question regarding whether the sets of requesters and workers must be disjoint.  Otherwise, I thought that the work was helpful for understanding what's going on in the field.  I was also interested in some of the citations under the "Quality Control" heading, as quality seems to be one of the most important issues related to this sort of problem.},

@techreport{Ipeirotis:2010a,
	Annote = {The author describes the results of a demographic survey published on Mechanical Turk -- ie, meta-Turking.  People from the USA are still the largest category of Turkers.  However, the author found that because Amazon supports paying Turkers in India in rupees (unlike in the past, where they could only be paid in Amazon gift cards), many Indians are now participating in Mechanical Turk.  A significant difference between American and Indian Turkers is that while Americans often Turk only to supplement their income, Indian Turkers often rely on Turk as their primary source of income.  This was correlated with the fact that in the US, the overwhelming majoring of Turkers are female, while the reverse is true in India.  The survey also found that Turkers tend to be both younger and less affluent than the rest of society.

A couple concerns I had with the study:
-- The author did not state whether Amazon supports paying Turkers in other countries besides the US and India in their own currencies.  If Amazon does so (or supports this feature in the future), the demographics could again change drastically.  It seems that people wanting to use MTurk for secondary income would be more willing to work for Amazon gift cards, as they are a good currency for buying things that people often spend their disposable income on (music, books, gadgets, etc.).
-- The author mentions that Turkers are poorer, younger, and have smaller families than the bulk of society.  However, since these factors are correlated, a more interesting comparison would have been comparing Turkers with census data for people with the same age distribution.
-- It was also meaningless to compare Indian Turkers' income from MTurk to income in the US.  A more interesting comparison would have been comparing their income to other Indians in their age range.  This would help to answer the important question of whether MTurk provides a competitive income in countries that are poorer than the US (though the wages seem so low to Americans).  This question is especially interesting for Indian Turkers since they are more likely to draw their primary income from MTurk.},

	Annote = {In this work, the author provides a statistical analysis of the Amazon Mechanical Turk marketplace.  The work seems to be motivated by the desire to promote MTurk as a viable marketplace for many companies.  Companies are interested in knowing various characteristics of the marketplace such as its size, its demographics, its quality, its responsiveness, etc.  

One serious flaw with their data collection is that they are agnostic to how many assignments are associated with each HIT (ie, each HIT can be performed by multiple different workers per the prerogative of the requester).  It's not clear to me how different their figures would be if they had been able to gather this data as well.  It's also not clear to me why it's so difficult to gather this info.

The main message of this paper is that the Power Law is descriptive of many aspects of the MTurk marketplace.  For example, a handful of requesters provide a disproportionate number of the HITs available.  Also, many HITs pay only a few cents (eg, < $.10), while some pay upwards of a dollar.  Another Power Law manifestation is in the time for a batch of HITs to complete -- most are finished within a couple of hours, but some can take over a week (depending on whether the requester renews the HIT).

The paper identified a number of interesting directions for further research.  For example, requesters would be interested in knowing how much they would have to pay for their HITs in order to receive the responses back within a certain time frame (eg, 24 hours).  Also, requesters would like more predictability regarding how long their HIT batch will take to complete.

Another interesting point raised by the paper is that queueing models may apply.  },

@inproceedings{Armbrust:2011,
	Annote = {In this work, the author presented a new system that can handle a wide variety of queries, while bounding the number of KVS operations. In this system, key value stores are used for the storage layer of the distributed database system. In order to successfully use KVS, it is necessary to have the following features: predictable performance, range scans, and atomic operations. It would also be helpful to additionally have namespaces, count, and batchget and batch range to reduce the overhead and allow more requests per query against the KVS. The architecture of this system is set up so that each app server has a PSQL library that communicates with the KV. This leaves the KVS unmodified, and the query processing resources are scaled-out with the application server. This also means some operations must be done remotely inside the KVS(evaluating predicates over unbounded relations), and others locally on the client(joins). The system minimizes the number of KVS trips by requesting records from KVS in batches, and issuing many requests in parallel. The paper also defined four remote operators: IndexProbe, IndexScan, IndexJoin, and SortedIndexJoin. Pagination is handled by pausing and resuming queries. The query optimizer only allows queries where an upper bound on the number of tuples returned and the number of KVS operations to be performed can be calculated, in order to ensure scale independence. Three changes were made to SQL to make PSQL performance safe: a restricted LIKE operator, aggregates and Group By on bounded sets of data only, and pagination instead of OFFSET. This paper also introduced a new operator-DataStop operator which ensures there will never be more than the specified number of tuples produced as a result of evaluating the plan beneath the operator. Experiments to determine the performance safeness showed that for TPC-W,  the response time per web interaction styated within the SLA bounds for 99th percentile, and parallelizing requests improved response time even more. For TweetBench, experiments showed a near-linear scale-up of throughput as the number of servers and clients increased. As with TPC-W, near linear scalability with low response time at the 99th percentile was also observed.},

This paper describes the design and implementation of the Performance Insightful Query Language (PIQL).  PIQL is designed for interactive web apps like Facebook and eBay.  It aims to have predictable performance like key-value stores, yet be more expressive like SQL, of which it is a subset.  To ensure performance will scale as the app's user base grows, queries must be bounded (eg, looking up users by their hometown returns max 100 users).  An interesting feature of the language is that it was designed to enable performance-consistency tradeoffs; for example, if the developer is willing to work with potentially stale data from an index or the closest replica (rather than consulting all replicas), performance will surely improve.  This is appropriate for some cases, such as a profile load, but not for others, such as user authentication.  The language acknowledges this and provides flexibility to handle both cases.  The simple prototype implementation shows good performance even as the number of users increases.  Next steps include adding aggregates and exploring the performance-consistency tradeoff space by implementing various other read/write policies.

	Annote = {In this work, the authors present a monitoring tool designed to enable more intuitive and expressive interaction between system administrators and the systems they manage.  The system administrators can provide hypotheses to the system by which they encode their beliefs about its behavior; eg, "the throughput will increase linearly."  As conditions change, the monitoring tool will determine whether the administrator's hypotheses continue to hold; if they do not, the tool raises an alert.

The key components of the monitoring tool are a declarative language called SelfTalk, which administrators may use to encode their beliefs, and a runtime support system called Dena, which collects various metrics and uses them to check whether the hypotheses hold.  Each hypothesis also has at least one context in which it is expected to hold.  When the system is operating in a hypothesis's context, Dena will check to see whether the hypothesis holds; otherwise, the hypothesis will be ignored.

A positive feature of this work is that system administrators are not required to construct accurate models of the system's behavior; in contrast, they merely enter their guesses as to how it will behave.  Some related work, including Eno Thereska's IRONModel paper, do require that models be created.

A criticism of this work is that in the introduction, the authors emphasize their tool's "self-expression" that evolves the way a human child's expression matures as he grows from infancy.  However, the explanation in the rest of the paper does not touch on any evolution in the tool's expression; in fact, the extent of its expression is reporting to the system administrator which hypotheses no longer hold.  This was disappointing, given the introduction.

A hole in the evaluation is the lack of justification for the use of the Akash virtual storage system.  Presumably, the authors chose to use this because it gave them more insight into the various modules' operation, where monitoring the corresponding functionality in a full OS may have been more difficult.  However, it seems that whenever there is a departure from reality, it is necessary to justify what has been gained by that departure.  The evaluation may have been more convincing if they had run on a modified version of Linux instead.},

	Annote = {In this work, the authors have presented a modeling framework.  The key idea is that the modeling should be integrated with the system rather than being applied to the system after it has been developed, since otherwise it is too difficult to keep them in synch.  Another interesting assumption is that neither the system nor the model is trusted; instead, the authors perform mismatch localization whenever the model and the system diverge and then require further analysis to identify the cause.  Sometimes, humans must be involved in this analysis.  The work relies on two of Thereska's previous projects:  Stardust, a monitoring system, and Ursa Minor, a storage system.  The key idea for the modeling framework is that the system administrator or developer can specify how they expect that operations such as reading a file from several replicas will be carried out, with respect to the structure of the request (ie, which machines it will touch) as well as its performance (ie, how long a particular communication should take).  They will then observe during runtime whether or not the expectation matches the system's actual performance.  An interesting feature of the modeling phase is that it can make initial predictions without any training data, based on the human-supplied expectations.  Then, as execution is observed, it can refine its predictions.  It can also retrain if its data becomes obsolete due to changes to the system.  This is well-suited for the changing conditions present in real systems.

Notes (1.26.10):
They have a similar approach to ours (for the PIQL query latency prediction) in that they model each resource ("service center", in their terminology) independently and then compose the models.  Each resource's model may be obtained through benchmarking or simulation.

A disadvantage of their work is that it requires a lot of explicit specification from the developer/system administrator, and the approach is complicated, as they have to think about each hardware resource (network, disk, cache, etc.).  By contrast, our work allows developers to focus their attention on queries, rather than worrying about individual resources.  You could say that our motto is, "Let's see how far we can get keeping things as simple as possible."},

Notes from Aug. 31, 2009:
This work presents a queueing model for multi-tier web applications that is used for predicting the workload's average response time.  They do so via the mean-value analysis (MVA) algorithm; given the input parameters (number of concurrent sessions, average service times of each tier, tier visit ratios, and average user think time), the model outputs the average delay at each tier and the average response time.  

The authors provide a solid experimental section, in which they vary the workload, the implementation of the application tier, and the type of host machines.  The model's predictions are within the observed response times for most of the experiments.  This shows that the model is applicable in a variety of settings and therefore not tied to any particular setting; however, they did not perform experiments testing the ability of their model, when trained in a given scenario, to extrapolate to unseen situations.

Another serious limitation of this work is that due to the authors' use of the MVA algorithm, they cannot extend this work as-is to predicting higher percentiles of the response time, as is necessary due to the way today's SLAs are expressed \cite{DeCandia:2007}.  

Some specific notes:
-- p.1:  "Various application tiers such as Web, Java, and database servers have vastly different performance characteristics and collectively modeling their behavior is a difficult task."
Further support for my decision to move to a per-tier modeling approach and scrap the monolithic approach.

-- p.2:  "A key contribution of our work is that the complex task of modeling a multi-tier application is reduced to the modeling of request processing at individual tiers and the flow of requests across tiers."
Should cite; it sounds like they're the first to successfully model a multi-tier app.

-- p.2:  they mention that they handle caching
I wonder, is caching easier to capture when you're predicting average response times (as opposed to 99%)?  Might depend on the hit ratio; if the hit ratio is high, just a few outliers would constitute the misses, and the mean would not be much affected by these outliers.

-- The authors think in terms of sessions & explicitly include sessions in their model's structure.  Do we need to do this as well?

-- p.3:  "in the general case, each request at tier T_i can trigger multiple requests to tier T_{i+1}."
Supports the idea of each tier having its own arrival distribution (possibly related to/parameterized in terms of the previous tier's arrival distribution).

-- Section 2.3:  some of the papers sound really interesting even though they only apply to single-tier applications

-- Want to know more about queueing theory -- what do these abbreviations mean (eg, G/G/1)?

Section 3.1:
-- "our model can handle multiple visits to a tier regardless of whether they occur sequentially or in parallel"
In Cloudstone, are the requests issued serially or in parallel?

-- next paragraph:  "caching effects are naturally captured by this model" -- cool!

-- Closed-loop workload generation

-- Section 3.2:  "The use of visit ratios in lieu of transition probabilities enables the model to capture multiple visits to a tier regardless of whether they occur sequentially or in parallel"
In a simulation, would we have to treat these cases separately?

Section 3.3:
-- "parameters can be estimated by monitoring the application as it services its workload"
So they are doing empirical parameter estimates, albeit only at low load.  Unclear if the service times would change for higher loads.
The authors use the "Utilization Law" (from their reference [10]) to estimate the service time during overloads.  How well does this work?  It seems that our approach of using the data at various workload levels during training could be more accurate; however, maybe it would be more applicable to practical settings if we could estimate the change in service time from the available service time estimates.

-- "residence time includes the time spent by the request at this tier and all the subsequent tiers that processed this request"
This is a good explanation of how they were able to get the per-tier service times from the residence times (residence times are what I get, for example, from the Rails log).

Section 4:
-- Haproxy serves as our sentry, turning away connections when the limit is reached.

-- If concurrency limits are implicit, you'd have to discover them; the paper acts as if concurrency limits are explicit and therefore readily available.

-- Common approach:  start with a baseline model and gradually add enhancements.  Show that performance goes up as you add the enhancements.

Section 6.2:
-- Figure 7(a) -- the model & observed response times don't appear to coincide at 100 sessions; in fact, it seems that the observed may be leveling out due to concurrency limits, while the model is linearly increasing.  Why do they limit the x-axis to 100 sessions (cf Figure 4)?

-- they compute the average response time over 30 second intervals
I want to finish my long interval code so I can figure out the best interval in which to compute 99% response time

-- Section 7:  good to show utility of the model
This is what I should've done in my IISWC paper, as the reviewers mentioned},

@inproceedings{Hoste:2006,
	Annote = {The goal of this paper is to address the main problem of benchmarking, which is using benchmarks and their performance data to determine the most suitable platform for a new application.  The authors represent each benchmark and each target application with a set of 47 microarchitecture-independent features.  Then, they obtain a data transformation matrix that serves to project the feature matrix to a space that they deem as the benchmark space.  To predict performance for a new application, they project its feature representation to the benchmark space and use a combination of the performance data of the application's nearest neighbors (the closest few points among the projected benchmarks).  This approach is very similar to the method presented in \cite{Ganapathi:2009}.  The authors test out a few approaches to the data transformation problem, including normalization, PCA, and a genetic algorithm.  They determined that the genetic algorithm was the most helpful.  It seemed that for the genetic algorithm approach, they authors actually used PCA to determine the benchmark space and then used the genetic algorithm to determine how to weight the nearest neighbors when producing the performance prediction for the query point.  This was a bit unclear in the presentation; the authors made it seem like the use of the genetic algorithm was separate from the use of PCA.  The authors demonstrated via their experimental results that they were able to improve on the baseline, a simpler method called "average speedup" which was current practice when this paper was written; that is, their genetic algorithm approach achieved a rank correlation coefficient of 0.892, whereas the baseline achieved a coefficient of 0.83.  In summary, the authors were able to significantly improve upon the baseline solution to a very important problem in benchmarking.

Note:  The authors made use of PCA, but they never mentioned the term "machine learning."  This may be smart, as it allows them to avoid the controversy associated with the term.},

@inproceedings{Dahlin:2006,
	Annote = {Novel Idea:  The authors have presented the PRACTI paradigm, providing partial replication (PR), arbitrary consistency (AC), and topology independence (TI).  No previous replication system provides all three properties.
Main Result(s):  The authors have devised a replication system architecture that provides all three PRACTI properties.  They have also presented a prototype replication toolkit that can be used to create replication systems and have employed the toolkit to emulate existing systems in order to demonstrate PRACTI-based replication's system implementation and performance advantages.
Impact:  The authors demonstrated that it is in fact possible to obtain all three PRACTI properties when creating replication systems.  This likely caused a significant paradigm shift, since previously, people seemed to think that only two of the three were obtainable (similar to the CAP situation).
Evidence:  First, the authors flesh out the problems with existing systems that only provide two of the three PRACTI properties.  Then, they present the rationale for their design.  This is followed by a description of their PRACTI-based prototype.  The empirical evaluation is divided into three parts, one for each PRACTI property, in which the authors demonstrate the superiority of their PRACTI system over other systems which are missing the section's property.
Prior Work:  Many other replication systems have been developed (see Figure 1).  The authors also draw upon Eric Brewer's CAP Theorem and the use of distinct invalidation messages which have been used in hierarchical caching systems but not in systems in which all-to-all connection is available.
Competitive work:  No previous replication system, of which there are many, provides all three PRACTI properties.
Reproducibility:  Reproducing the findings would be quite difficult, since the authors included results from several different replication systems which the authors used PRACTI to emulate.
Question:  The authors mention in the introduction that their PRACTI system dominates AC-TI, PR-AC, and PR-TI systems along various dimensions.  Is the PRACTI system inferior along any dimension?  If so, what; and how would you compare the importance of the various dimensions?
Criticism:  The introduction should have more clearly articulated the motivation for the three PRACTI properties.  Also, the authors used PRACTI to emulate the systems to which they compared their PRACTI-based system in the Evaluation section -- this does not seem to be a fair comparison.  They should have at least provided more detail about how the other systems were emulated.
Ideas for further work:  I would like to compare the PRACTI-based replication system produced by the authors to the actual systems to which PRACTI was compared (not just the emulated versions).  How much of the advantage of their system was due to PRACTI, and how much was due to their implementations of the other systems?

	Annote = {Traditionally, operating systems have considered only the kernel state to be internal state, while application state has been deemed external; this is called an application-centric paradigm.  The authors propose applying to file systems a user-centric paradigm  inspired by the notion of consistent recovery from fault tolerance, so that internal state includes both kernel and application state, and external state comprises merely that which is visible to the user.  The user-centric paradigm enables a compromise between previously-existing synchronous and asynchronous file systems called external synchrony that achieves near-asynchronous performance while presenting a synchronous interface to the user, simplifying application development and allowing applications written for synchronous file systems to run unmodified.  The authors demonstrate this through experiments comparing their externally synchronous file system, xsyncfs, with ext3, Linux's existing file system.  Rather than blocking an application when it performs a write as synchronous file systems would do, xsyncfs allows the application to continue executing while logging the requested write.  However, the application is not allowed to output to the user or to the disk until the writes on which the output depends have committed.  The writes are batched until the application issues output that depends on the writes; at that point, the OS is able to amortize the cost of accessing the disk over many writes.  They refer to this idea as output-triggered commits.  The idea of allowing the application to proceed with its execution rather than blocking it until the write operation has completed comes from the authors' previous project Speculator, which allowed processes to speculate on the return value of RPCs.  However, their file system solution does not require the full power of Speculator, since they do not ever need to roll back the application's execution after it issued a write request.  The authors demonstrate the performance of xsyncfs by running several benchmarks, including Postmark, Apache build, MySQL, and SPECweb, thereby providing fairly good coverage of workloads of interest.  On Postmark, the best case for xsyncfs due to its few outputs, xsyncfs outperformed ext3 by 1-2 orders of magnitude.  On the others, xsyncfs's performance was comparable.  The authors' idea is simple and has great potential to improve file system performance while still guaranteeing durability; however, the authors would have done well to devote more discussion to the components of Speculator that were really necessary for this domain, since many were superfluous.},

Dryad allows programs that are expressed as a DAG, where the vertices are data operations and the edges are data channels, to be executed on either local computers or in the private data center in a manner that is transparent to the developer.  LINQ is an important programming language development that adds queries to .NET languages such as C#, F#, and VB.  This work uses LINQ to add a layer on top of Dryad, so developers may write programs in Visual Studio using either declarative or object-oriented syntax and familiar APIs which are then compiled such that they may be executed on the Dryad system.  This compiler support has been integrated into Visual Studio to simplify programming.  The main contribution of DryadLINQ is the ease with which developers may now create programs for a wide variety of applications such as machine learning and log processing in a familiar manner that may be executed in parallel; developers do not have to plan the execution graph but may instead focus on their applications.  The authors argue that though Dryad has a strong flavor of parallel databases, including compiler-generated optimization plans which strongly resemble query plans, a key difference is that DryadLINQ may be used with imperative languages like C# to simplify iterative queries, which cannot be conveniently expressed via SQL.  DryadLINQ also accomplishes some of the same goals as the well-known Map-Reduce/Hadoop; however, the computational model is less constraining with DryadLINQ, since the computation may be represented as an arbitrary graph rather than the more rigid Map-Reduce, which makes use of single Map and Reduce stages.  The less constrained DAG structure of DryadLINQ execution plans also enables reuse of data among vertices.  DryadLINQ is widely used within Microsoft and facilitates many of the large-scale, data-intensive computations that are currently of interest.},

	Annote = {In this work, the authors present Quanto, an energy profiler for sensornets.  They are motivated by the fact that energy is the key constraint in sensornets, which are often deployed in harsh environments and expected to continue operation for months or years without new batteries.  They argue that previous related work which claims to monitor energy usage actually monitors things that may or may not be related to energy, such as packets transferred.  They instead take the approach of directly monitoring the energy usage of each system component and then summarizing the component-level information by the activities (eg, blinking an LED) on whose behalf the components are executing.  To monitor the energy usage, they present a simple sensor called iCount, which is manufactured by wiring the switching regulator to the microcontroller and can be read as easily as any counter; this is in contrast to sensors that may be expensive to read.  The other key component of this work is activity tracking, which is achieved by painting a resource with the activities whose sub-tasks it is executing.  When resources are shared, they are painted with multiple colors, and linear regression is used to determine the contribution of each activity.  This is useful for determining the energy impact of various implementation choices at the system level.  The authors demonstrate their technique applied to toy applications like blinking an LED as well as to a case study considering the impact of noise to the power savings of low power listening.  This technique could prove quite useful to sensornet developers as they attempt to operate within their key constraint.},

Time is a very important commodity for distributed systems; it is important for hosts on the WAN to be synchronized for application domains such as finance.  The protocol is meant to provide synchronization despite the small number of points from which the most accurate atomic clock time is broadcast.  Servers participating in the network are either primary or secondary sources based on the indirection by which they are synchronized with the atomic clock sources.  A key feature of this protocol is its defensive approach to fault tolerance, making use of redundancy to account for the presence of truechimers, reliable servers, and falsetickers, which should not be trusted to provide accurate timing information.  The author employs statistical reasoning for parameter estimation, with the key parameter of interest being the offset between clocks.  He argues that instead of the typical sample mean, a minimum estimator is appropriate, since the sample for which the minimum round trip time was observed has the most information about the true offset between clocks.  To avoid sensitivity to outliers, the author employs the criteria that the true minimum-delay sample should have many similar samples; he expresses this in Figure 5, showing that their is a tight cluster of samples located near the minimum.  These design decisions combined to produce a protocol that has remained useful for an impressive amount of time and has strongly influenced thinking about distributed systems.

@article{Lamport:1978,
	Annote = {In this important work, Leslie Lamport presents the notion that chronological or physical time introduces many complications to work in distributed systems since it requires synchronization across a network of machines; he proposes instead a notion of logical time which has more to do with the order in which events occur.  He defines a "happened before" relation which establishes the possibility of causal relationships between events rather than attempting to establish the exact time at which the events occurred.  The "happened before" relations among events are based on timestamps, which are more a mark of sequence than of actual physical time and are included in headers accompanying interprocess communication.  These timestamps may be used to produce a partial ordering which can then be linearized to a total ordering for reasoning purposes; this concept is similar to the partial-order plans presented in Chapter 11 of Russell & Norvig's AI:  A Modern Approach.  Lamport also introduces the clock condition, which is satisfied if we have that (1) within a process, messages' timestamps are increasing with the order in which they occur, and (2) across processes, a message sent from process P_i to process P_j has a later timestamp at receipt than at transmission.  Lamport gives an interesting presentation of how this protocol may be applied through an example of a distributed solution to mutual exclusion.  He also describes how this approach can be utilized for synchronizing physical clocks, a very difficult problem, and bounds the synchronization error in terms of various properties of the system.  This work, though filled with nuances and therefore difficult to understand at first pass, has been critical for producing distributed systems that actually work over the WAN and has influenced practical protocols such as NTP, which is an Internet standard today.},

Dynamo is a data store that supports only primary-key access to the
data in order to provide high availability, which is crucial to
Amazon's business.  For many of the services used with the Amazon
site, including shopping cart and best-seller lists, such access is
sufficient.  Dynamo operates on a system which is quite decentralized
over myriad servers housed in many globally-distributed datacenters.
Also, it must be fault-tolerant, since the servers are commodity
components; in fact, failure is such a common case that Dynamo is
designed to treat failure as the normal case.  This is in contrast to
database systems in which recovery is allowed to be slow and expensive
since it is so rarely necessary.  With respect to the CAP theorem,
Dynamo lives in the AP sector, since high availability is supremely
desired and the vast amount of data requires partitioning; eventual
consistency is deemed sufficient.  Performance is also deemed
important; thus, the Dynamo team included some clever tricks such as
buffered writes to improve latencies (trading off a bit of risk of
reduced durability).  Dynamo has been used during the busy Christmas
shopping season of 2006 to provide high availability and reduced
latency for the Amazon.com shopping site.

In Figure 4, the authors present the client latencies for reads and
writes, for the average and 99.9 percentile.  They observe that the
latencies follow a diurnal pattern; that is, that they peak during the
daytime.  However, the 99.9-percentile read latency follows an
opposite pattern, peaking during the nighttime.  The authors fail to
comment on this.  It is probably caused by the fact that reads are
checked against the main-memory object buffer before going to disk; at
high-traffic times, more will be in the object buffer, so there is a
higher probability of finding the query object in the buffer.

Also, in the discussion in section 6.6, the authors remark that
Dynamo's key advantage is that the (N, R, W) knobs allow developers to
tune the system in order to achieve their desired SLA, where N is the
number of nodes serving a request, R is the number of readers, and W
is the number of writers.  However, they do not shed any light on how
(N, R, W) may be chosen, given a goal SLA; they only say what their
choice was.  They should have included some information about the
relationship between a given SLA and these parameters.  It would have
been even more convincing if they had done some experiments with
various choices of (N, R, W).  Given that they say that this is the
key advantage of Dynamo, there should have been more support for this
claim.},

	Annote = {In this paper, the authors present Speculator, which is a feature of distributed file systems that allows client processes to predict the results of RPCs and speculatively execute in the interim between the issuance of the RPC and its return.  They observe that this is a good approach in the distributed file system setting, since there is high potential for correct RPC return value prediction due to the rareness of concurrent file updates; however, the authors should have given an estimate of the frequency of these concurrent updates.  The main potential for performance improvement comes from the fact that instead of processes blocking as they wait on RPCs, they may utilize the time, and since predicted values are often correct, rollbacks are rare.  Another interesting feature of the file system is that Speculator keeps track of causal dependencies due to a process speculatively executing issuing calls to other processes; if the root speculative process must roll back due to an incorrect prediction, all processes it has influenced roll back as well.  To maintain the ability of all processes to roll back, processes may not take unrecoverable actions, such as output to the user or a reboot system call, until the accuracy of their predictions has been confirmed.  An impressive result of the work is that both in LAN and WAN settings, the speculative file system BlueFS, which provides strong-consistency single-copy semantics, outperforms file systems that have weaker semantics, such as close-to-open consistency.

A weakness in one of the authors' experiments was that to show the speculative file systems' performance in the situation where rollback is necessary, they appended garbage characters to the end of various files.  Then, whereas in the setting of the non-speculative NFS, processes blocked until their RPCs to obtain valid copies of the file from the server returned, processes executing in the speculative environment were able to continue to execute while waiting for the valid files from the server.  It seems flawed to append the garbage characters to the file rather than to insert them at random points in the file; real file updates would happen at arbitrary points in the file, which has more potential to impact processes using out-of-date copies of the file.  Also, it seems that the real key to the performance enhancement is that processes may take advantage of the time they are waiting for the server to respond to RPCs; thus, high-latency situations are where this approach will really be beneficial.  The authors should have been a bit clearer about this earlier, such as when they introduced their figures for speedup in LAN vs. WAN settings.},

	Annote = {In this paper, the IBM authors provide an explanation of the features of their open-source OS research project, K42.  The work was done in cooperation with researchers at the University of Toronto and is closely tied to the Tornado OS; however, I did not feel that the strength of the ties between IBM and University of Toronto was clearly communicated.  The authors make some interesting predictions about the development of the industry to motivate their design decisions, which they then evaluate at the end of the paper.  One comment was about how historically, OSes were designed to be monolithic; whereas the authors have created K42 to be a microkernel with an object-oriented design that provides customizability and extensibility.  It was interesting that because they were betting that 64-bit processors would gain significant popularity, they tailored the OS to 64-bit; however, since 64-bit processors have not become as widespread as they expected, the K42 OS has had limited use.

Motivated by enabling use on manycore chips, the authors emphasize the importance of locality and the resulting suitability for microkernels, in that each processor should use nearby memory in order to reduce the need for locks in the shared-memory setting.  Microkernels are suitable in this setting because each application is served by OS object instances that are instantiated locally.  The authors also emphasize customization, which is attained via the microkernel's design in which each resource (eg, file) is served by its own set of object instances.  This customization can be quite fine-grained, with even multiple management policies used for a single application.  More discussion about how to choose and change the policies would be interesting; however, the authors do not seem to provide this, as they state that developers could add adaptive algorithms on top of their K42 OS.  A key component of the OS, which is enabled by the OO design, is hot-swap, in which active components that share interfaces can be swapped out without disturbing any running applications.  Another interesting idea was the use of multi-level scheduling, where the kernel scheduler allocates time to processes, and each process has one or more "dispatchers" which schedule its threads.  This allows each process to make full use of its allotted time, even if one or more of its threads block due to I/O.  It also prevents processes from greedily using the system's resources by simply spawning more threads; in the K42 setting, all processes receive the same treatment by the OS, regardless of the number of constituent threads.  However, this might not be a good thing, in the case where one process is very simple and thus has few threads, whereas another process is performing many important and compute-intensive tasks and would therefore benefit from receiving more compute time.  Perhaps a priority mechanism should be employed that would schedule processes according to their relative importance while preventing misbehaving processes from monopolizing system resources.

Early on in the paper, the authors mentioned that customizability of the OS to suit particular applications is highly desirable; however, they did not make it clear that by managing each resource by its own set of object instances, concurrent applications can effectively have their own versions of the OS.  It seemed that a single instance of the OS would have to be tweaked for a particular application, and then optimal performance would be obtained only by running a homogeneous application set on the OS.  By including a brief comment about how the customization could be done on a per-application basis because of the modularity in their design, they would have made a stronger argument throughout the paper (rather than later in the paper, when this point became clear).},

	Annote = {The authors have applied machine learning to predicting multiple metrics of queries, both short and long.  They first develop the utility of the work; query metric prediction is useful both for control (deciding when to abort long-running queries) and resource provisioning (deciding how many resources are needed, given a query task list).  Then, they distinguish their work by pointing out that much related work has been limited in that it only predicts a single metric or that it needs runtime information.  They provide a thorough justification for their use of KCCA, including showing that simple regression did not suffice, as well as arguing for the benefit of using a dual-view representation of the data (with features available before running the queries as well as the runtime performance information).  The prediction results are quite impressive.  An interesting suggestion for future work is that KCCA be improved in order to adapt to a nonstationary workload, so that it would exhibit recency weighting.  This brings to mind reinforcement learning; it would be a great improvement to the technique if the clusters could adapt as more data is seen, and it would be fascinating to observe the resulting impact on prediction accuracy.

The authors mention that clustering solely on either the features derived from the query plan or from the runtime statistics would be insufficient for predicting, since queries that would cluster together based on query plans might not actually share behavoir.  This is why the CCA approach is so natural; it takes into account both the information available before running the queries and the actual behavior of the queries when determining which points should cluster together.  I would have liked to see the authors provide  experimental results showing that the clusters obtained from the raw data did not match and thus would yield poor predictions.  In my work, I should provide such results on the raw data that I obtain.},

@article{Kohler:2000,
	Annote = {The authors have presented an extensible framework for creating customizable routers.  They argue that current routers are very off-the-shelf and not amenable to customization.  Their work presents a set of building blocks that may be used to easily create routers in a declarative manner, in which router designers create a directed graph whose nodes are elements (such as Classifier, Paint, and DecIPTTL) and whose edges represent the direction of packet flow between elements.  The authors then demonstrate how their framework may be used to create an IP router.  Another key feature of Click is the ease of adaptation from one specification to another; the authors present an example of modifying the IP router to give other functionality such as inclusion of several alternative packet scheduling algorithms.  The authors also provide an empirical evaluation of the framework and show that their Click IP router achieved a better forwarding rate than the Linux IP router.  Click is a valuable framework for declarative, extensible router design.

It seems that there is a tradeoff between modularity and performance that the authors did not fully flesh out.  They did an interesting experiment in which they created an IP router with 16 elements along the forwarding path (shown in Figure 8), with which they observed a 1.57us cost of pushing through the forwarding path.  Then, to investigate the impact of modularity, they implemented two new elements that allowed them to assess the amount of time spent on virtual function calls (due to the Element interface from which all Click modules are derived).  These new elements allowed them to create the same IP router with a forwarding path of only 8 stages.  The resulting push cost was 1.03us.  By inserting dummy elements so that the second implementation had 8 functional elements and 8 dummy stages, they observed a push cost of 1.58us, which allowed them to conclude that the difference between the two path costs is purely time spent in virtual function calls.  This is quite a significant difference in push cost which warrants a more rigorous defense of the high degree of modularity provided with the Element interface.  Perhaps they could have maintained extensibility yet saved on push cost by creating a more hierarchical interface; that is, instead of having a single Element class from which all modules are derived, the authors could create some intermediate classes that would group the modules according to function and save time on the virtual function calls.},

	Annote = {This paper presents a very significant problem with TCP, which is that misbehaving receivers can exploit the protocol to increase their own throughput (this work is important because before, much work had been focused on sender-side misbehavior, while receiver-side conduct was largely ignored).  This is in part due to the fact that TCP was designed as a communication protocol for trusted environments; however, the internet is not actually a trusted environment, since each individual receiver has an incentive to exploit its senders.  The authors present three types of attacks a receiver may perpetrate, which they dub ACK division, DupACK spoofing, and optimistic ACKing.  They also describe modifications to TCP that will render these attacks powerless.  An interesting facet of the paper is Table 1, in which the authors present a list of many different OSes and their vulnerabilities to receiver-side TCP attacks; most of the OSes considered were vulnerable to all three types of attacks.  The authors point out that with their modifications to TCP, receivers can no longer increase the rate of transmission from the sender; instead, a receiver can only decrease it, which the authors state can only harm itself.  However, it might be the case that a receiver could lessen the rate of transmission at the sender for other clients as well; the authors should have included a bit more explanation as for why this would not be the case.},

	Annote = {In this paper, the authors discuss how to avoid congestion on the internet.  The two main algorithms they present are slow start and congestion avoidance.  Slow start has to do with the appropriate way for senders to commence transmission.  It was inspired by the chicken-and-egg problem caused by the fact that TCP is self-clocking in that senders use acks to determine when to send subsequent packets; at startup, the lack of ack packets means that senders don't know the appropriate rate of transmission.  Slow start is a way to gradually work up to the bottleneck capacity by increasing the packet transmission rate as more acks are received.  Congestion avoidance uses timeout as a signal, since, as the authors point out, it is almost always the case that congestion leads to packet loss which leads to timeout.  This allows for the portion of retransmitted packets to be lessened.  In the introduction, the authors discuss an occasion on which they observed their data throughput decreasing by a factor of 1000.  This was the inspiration for their work on congestion control.  I would have appreciated some concluding remarks about the cause of this slowdown in terms of congestion and the way that their slow-start and congestion avoidance algorithms would prevent this from happening in the future; I feel that this would have tied things together a bit more.},

Thus, to realize the increased efficiency for which faster networks offer a potential, it is important to streamline these endpoints by moving the protocol stack into the user space.  The authors also remark that virtualization of the network interface is a natural approach, since it is desirable to present to the application a perception that the application has exclusive access to the interface.  The key focus of the paper is that the authors are able to increase the efficiency of the endpoints using commodity hardware, which is different from pre-existing work, which made the same attempts using very expensive specialty hardware.  The authors also point out that small message efficiency is very important.  The results were quite impressive in that the authors were able to obtain lower overhead than their competitors, who used specialty hardware.  This work achieved its goal to raise the standard for message-passing frameworks in that it really challenged any work that resorts to specialty hardware.  One aspect of the paper that I took issue with was that in their discussion of Figure 4, the authors asserted that the bandwidth achieved by their U-Net Active Messages (UAM) layer was so close to that which may obtained from the raw U-Net interface that it is rarely worthwhile to use the raw interface.  However, it seems that for small messages, which the authors claim to be quite important, the bandwidth was significantly less for UAM than raw, which suggests that the UAM layer may be less desirable when many small messages are sent. },

They argue that while microkernels have received much attention from academia, they are unsuitable for practical use.  One of the arguments for the superiority of VMMs to microkernels is that VMMs are created to support existing OSes, which allows applications to run on the VM without being modified, whereas with microkernels, since the API presented is altered, emulators must be written so that applications may be ported smoothly.  The authors also mention that a weakness of the microkernel approach is the difficulty in keeping up with the development of mainstream OSes; however, for a VMM like Xen, whose paravirtualization approach requires that guest OSes be rewritten, the same problem exists -- new developments to OSes mean that new versions must be written for Xen.  VMware avoids this problem by providing full hardware virtualization such that no modification to the guest OS is needed; thus, updated versions of the OS can be immediately installed on a VMware VM (vs. Xen, where the OS must be modified first).  This paper was met by another of the same name submitted to ACM SIGOPS in 2006 (the following year).  The authors of the follow-up paper challenged almost every claim made by Hand et al.  One of the mistakes made by Hand et al. was the way they totally discounted all microkernels-related research and suggested that most systems research in academia is futile.  The argument would have been more compelling if they had been more judicious in their communication.},

	Annote = {The authors present Xen, a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that is created via the paravirtualization approach which presents to the guestOS hardware that is similar but not identical to the physical hardware.  The authors describe some of the challenges involved with virtualization, including the essential property that VM instances be isolated from each other, especially in the case where users are mutually untrusting.  Paravirtualization helps the authors avoid some of the problems with full virtualization, where the VM presents a view of the hardware that is identical to the physical hardware, which include an adverse impact on performance; however, it requires that the guestOS be modified from its original form.  The authors created XenoLinux, which they experimentally compare with Linux running natively.  XenoLinux performed very well, almost reaching the performance of native Linus; this is consistent with the authors' statements about the necessity of VMs incurring little overhead.  This is especially impressive given the poor benchmark performance of alternatives to Xen such as VMware workstation 3.2 and User-Mode Linus (see Figure 3).  One thing that detracted from the paper's impact is that throughout the early sections, the authors discussed their work on modifying Windows XP to run on Xen, which they dub XenXP.  However, they had not yet completed it such that they could benchmark it.  They should have made that clear earlier in the paper.  Also, the authors repeatedly emphasized the necessity for VM instances to be isolated from each other, such that a VM would not be impacted by the presence of other VMs.  However, they did not address what would happen if a VM were running alone on a machine vs. if it were running with many other VM instances.  Clearly, in the latter case, the VM will have to compete for resources, while in the former case, the VM would benefit from utilizing the system's full resources.  To truly provide isolation, a VM could only be provisioned the resources that it would receive in the many-instance case, regardless of the actual load; however, it would be a shame to waste the available resources in the few-instance case.  Finally, the authors argue for small modifications to the OS.  However, this seems like a poor design decision.  First, it complicates installation, since the Xen providers would either have to package their OS with the VM or provide it for download.  More importantly, it appears to detract from their goal of supporting existing OSes.  It is not strictly true that a new OS could be rapidly deployed on their VM; someone would have to modify it.  This seems extremely undesirable.},

These clusters provided massive parallelism by which the database could be accessed.  The authors describe the key objectives in creating a parallel database, which are linear speedup and batch scaleup, both of which they were able to achieve with the parallel database.  They present various approaches to designing a database machine, of which the "shared nothing" design (where individual processors have their own memory and disks and communication is achieved over high-speed interconnect) has become dominant.  They also explain how various database operators could be split over partitions of the data whose results would then be merged to give the overall result.  This idea is evident in the MapReduce system, which merges results from the various independent workers.  The authors also mention some areas for future research.  One interesting point is that priority scheduling becomes an issue; the lottery scheduling idea (which was published after this paper) would be quite suitable for enabling applications in this setting to avoid priority inversion.  Another open question is access plan selection on a cluster vs. a single machine (the latter case is discussed by Selinger et al.).  The idea of partial order planning would be quite useful in this case; a partial ordering allows for identification tasks that can be executed in parallel, which would be quite natural in this case.},

	Annote = {The authors devised the MapReduce programming paradigm in order to isolate the mechanics of dealing with distributed systems from the logically simple computations such as determining term frequencies that developers at Google desired to execute.  This distributed computation was necessary because of the vast amounts of data that Google wanted to process.  To write a MapReduce computation, the developer will create Map (which translates initial key-value pairs to intermediate key-value pairs, where each intermediate key may have multiple associated values) and Reduce (which merges the intermediate results for each key) functions.  This paradigm is ideal for "embarassingly parallel" computations which are executed on large clusters, whose size are on the order of hundreds or thousands of machines.  By restricting the class of programs to which MapReduce is applicable, the framework is made powerful.  Also, its declarative nature hides the implementation from the developer, so that despite changes to the implementation, programs will continue to run [from Eric Brewer].  MapReduce computations are organized in a master-worker form, where the master maintains a task list, and workers request a task from the master as they become free.  The master distributes tasks according to each worker's suitability for performing the task, where suitability has to do with the locality to the data that will be needed to perform the computation.  Due to replication of workers, MapReduce achieves fault tolerance, an essential property given  the inevitability of hardware failures on such large clusters of commodity machines.  An interesting extension of MapReduce would be to computations that are not embarassingly parallel, that in fact do have dependencies among the workers.  The authors do not make any suggestion about this extension possibility.},

	Annote = {In this paper, the authors argue that particularly in the case of long-running queries, static query plans from optimizers are insufficient for promoting efficiency since the state of the database will change during the query's execution; therefore, it is desirable to continually adapt the query plan during the its execution.  The authors highlight that the selectivity, which is a strong cue for ordering operators to achieve vertical parallelism, can change while the query is being answered as large tables are scanned; this is a compelling argument for the necessity of an adaptive scheme.  Their solution involves the eddy, which directs the flow of tuples between operators, much like flow is impacted by physical eddies.  The authors achieve this dynamic scheduling of operators via the lottery paradigm of Waldspurger and Weihl.  As the eddy directs a tuple to an operator, it also assigns a ticket to the operator; when the operator feeds a tuple back to the eddy, it relinquishes one ticket.  The technique is not ready for horizontal parallelism at this point, since the data would have to be repartitioned due to operator reordering, which would be quite expensive.  The authors mention a desire to use reinforcement learning for ordering of dependent predicates; this would be an effective way to learn an ordering policy.  They currently make use of other ideas from reinforcement learning, such as recency weighting for tickets allocated to operators; tickets dispensed recently are worth more than those in the past.  An issue that arises as a result of this approach is setting the step size parameter; the authors mention that they would like to automatically tune this parameter rather than requiring that it be set by the user.  Some initial experiments for how to do so could involve tracking (in an online fashion) how well their lottery-based eddies perform relative to a deterministic baseline (such as the naive eddies approach) for various choices of the parameter; if they noticed poor performance from the lottery version, they could try adjusting the parameter and then observing the resulting relative performance.  I would have appreciated a bit more development of the analogy to fluid dynamics; this would have made the eddy's functionality more intuitively apparent.  Also, when they introduced the eddy, I would have appreciated some comments on how they avoid the eddy being a bottleneck, as well as its amenability to parallelization.  Finally, I am curious as to why the authors did not try the Stride scheduling algorithm also developed by Waldspurger and Weihl, which is the deterministic version of lottery scheduling, since Stride scheduling is what is used in practice for CPU scheduling.  They should have at least defended their choice of lottery over Stride.},

He presents two views of parallelism:  bracket (which had already been in use) and operator (which was his novel contribution).  Bracket parallelism uses a template approach, where the operator must plug into a template that allows one or two inputs and one output.  The main disadvantage of bracket parallelism is that all data movement between operators is accomplished via expensive inter-process communication (IPC) system calls.  Also, a separate scheduler for the operators is needed, since the control is decentralized to each operator.  In contrast, the novel operator parallelism paradigm is presented.  Operator parallelism had as its goal to make possible changeless porting of code from a single-processor machine to a multi-processor machine; it accomplishes this with operators that are self-scheduling and do not need to be modified to run in parallel due to the key module called the exchange operator.  The exchange operator gives meaning to the "encapsulation" mentioned in the paper's title, since all parallelization is accomplished in this single module.  It works by forking so as to create both child and parent processes, where the child functions as the producer and the parent functions as the consumer.  This two-process exchange operator serves as a link between operators, such that it is not necessary for the other operators to be aware of parallelism.  This is the key contribution of the work; parallelism is accomplished, and ease of use by developers is maintained.  One thing that was unclear was that while the author criticized bracket parallelism's reliance on IPC system calls, the exchange operator also makes use of IPC calls between its constituent child and parent processes.  The author could have made the distinction clearer by doing an empirical analysis of bracket parallelism compared with his operator parallelism; this would have been useful for demonstrating the superiority of his approach to that which was already in use.

	Annote = {This paper presents a method for choosing minimum-cost access paths, given a SQL query.  They use heuristic-guided search to prune high-cost paths and identify the minimum-cost path.  One of the high-level purposes of the work is to demonstrate that queries in SQL can be made just as efficient (or at least, with comparable efficiency) as queries in languages where the user must specify more information about how the query should be done (the usual low-level with high performance vs. high-level with user friendliness debate).  The authors argue that their access path selector often chose the optimal path, although this work does not contain quantitative results to support this claim.  They admit that althought absolute cost values may be off (by how much?  no idea), the relative costs are useful; it seems that there may be some systemic estimation error.  The authors make a good point that the time spent in the optimizer is amortized over the time that the program is used (for queries that are part of programs rather than issued by users at the terminal); with this point, it seems obvious that access path selection can result in a big savings in computation during a program's lifetime.  The authors present a parametric formula for computing the cost of an access path, where the parameters are W (the weight given to time spent in the CPU) and F (the selectivity parameter).  No discussion is given for how W is chosen, and though there is a detailed table for how F is set, some of the choices seem rather ad hoc.  I would have liked to see the authors give more support for their parameter selection method, including a comparison between the approach they settled on vs. an alternate method.

-- (2.3.10)  When evaluating a query's cost, the authors try to estimate the query's resource consumption rather than the query's actual latency.},

The authors have devised and implemented an interesting mechanism for avoiding the priority inversion problem where a high-priority task gets blocked; they provide for ticket transfer from one process to another.  An example of ticket transfer which the authors describe and experimentally demonstrate is where a client process transfers its tickets to the server to which it submits an RPC; this allows for the process to maintain its resource allocation relative to the other processes that are querying the server.  The authors also develop the notion of a currency system, which promotes encapsulation of a group of processes within a trust boundary.  Each currency is used within a trust boundary and funded by an amount of base currency tickets; there may be any number of tickets issued in terms of the currency, whose values are given by converting to the amount of base currency they represent.  The amount of tickets issued for a currency is independent of other currencies and does not affect its funding in base currency, so a currency's processes can inflate/deflate the currency by issuing more/fewer tickets.  The authors include many experiments, for verifying fairness (ensuring that the resource allocation to a process matches its ticket allocation), flexibility (demonstrating that adjusting a currency's funding impacts the importance of its constituent processes), the client-server ticket transfer, and other aspects of lottery scheduling.

The authors make good use of randomness; it appears from the discussion of prior work that previous priority-based approaches had been deterministic.  The authors claim that there is no problem with starvation because any process with a nonzero ticket count will eventually win a lottery and therefore be assigned a resource.  However, if a process has a relatively small ticket pool and there are many jobs arriving which obtain high ticket counts, the job could wait for quite a long time before receiving a resource.  It seems that the main underlying idea of a currency for a trust boundary is that new processes within that boundary can be allocated resources without disturbing tasks outside that boundary, and that this can be done without an explicit ticket transfer.  However, it seems that the overhead involved in the currency conversions would only be justified if there were so many processes within a boundary that the explicit transfers would be more expensive.  I would have liked to see a more thorough justification of the currency idea, as well as some discussion/experimentation demonstrating that the currency approach is warranted when compared to explicit transfer.  Finally, only the experiment with the Monte Carlo algorithm addresses how to allocate tickets.  If ticket allocation is done in an ad hoc manner, it seems that the only advantage of this scheme over priority is the randomness.  The authors should have addressed this problem.},

The authors from CMU suggest a dual approach to the concurrent transaction problem; instead of relying on locking for the usual case while resorting to rolling back transactions in the worst case, they propose that back off be the main approach, with locking being used only in the worst case.  They suggest that when systems are characterized by mostly queries, there can be a great savings with respect to overhead when locking is not used; because since conflicts will occur only rarely, it can be more efficient to take extra effort to resolve conflicts than to continually expend the effort involved in locking.  In this scheme, transactions are broken up into read, validation, and write phases, where the read phase normally does one or more disk accesses and thus dominates the overall length of the transaction.  The validation phase is quite short compared to the read phase, so this scheme results in significant savings.  In the case of validation failure, the transaction is aborted and restarted; if it fails repeatedly (which results in a "starving" transaction), the system falls back to granting a lock over the entire database to the transaction so that it may successfully complete.  It would have been interesting to know how often starvation occurs, because granting exclusive access to the entire database to the transaction could be quite expensive.  Also, the starvation detector is quite naive; it only detects a starving transaction when the transaction's validation phase has failed several times.  Using machine learning to classify a transaction as likely to starve would be much better; if such transactions could be identified without having to fail several times, they could be immediately granted a lock, thus reducing the overall response time.  Also, the authors rest their argument mostly on the assertion that their optimistic approach will result in better performance in the case of mostly queries; however, in such a case, the overhead could also be greatly reduced in a locking scheme.  The authors could have bolstered their argument by demonstrating that the relative savings is high with their system.},

@inproceedings{Gray:1976,
	Annote = {Researchers at IBM developed a scheme that allows for multiple granularities of locking to all be present at once in a database, from fine (a single record or interval of fields) to coarse (an entire file or area).  They present a strong argument for why multiple granularities are needed; fine promotes concurrency yet results in high overhead, while coarse allows low overhead at the expense of reduced concurrency.  They also introduce the idea of intention locking; since locking a node implicity grants access to all the node's descendants, all of a node's ancestors should reflect, via an intention lock, that the node has been locked so as not to inadvertently allow access to the node after it has been locked.  An appealing aspect is that a lock graph can be any arbitrary DAG; there is no restriction that the lock graph must be a tree.  They develop many related notions of compatibility between locking options, such as intention to read-only, which allows for sharing (IS), and intention to write, which is exclusive (IX).  After placing intention locks on all of a desired node's ancestors, the user will place a share/exclusive lock on the desired node.  This scheme allows for the optimal balance between concurrency and overhead; a process needing access to only a small amount of data may place a lock only on that data, promoting concurrency, while a process needing a large amount of data may lock at a higher level of the hierarchy, which is desirable from the perspective of minimizing overhead.  The authors also discuss different degrees of consistency that may be obtained.  Table 2 contains an excellent summary of the 4 degrees of consistency and their characteristics with respect to various criteria.  An important point which may be read from the table is that there is also a consistency vs. overhead tradeoff.  The conclusion is that they were able to create a variable-grained locking scheme that would still allow for multiple degrees of consistency, including the highest level, unlike related work, in which one or the other of these were obtained.  The paper could have been improved by condensing the section in which multiple definitions of the 4 degrees of consistency were given; it is difficult to keep the paper's intended trajectory in mind while the authors go into so much detail regarding these definitions.  Also, the comparison to related work would have been more compelling if the authors had analyzed the other systems' concurrency vs. overhead tradeoff, which they suggested was a key point early on in the paper.

	Annote = {SEDA (staged event-driven architecture) is a new paradigm for the design of well-conditioned Internet services that exhibit graceful degradation in response time when the capacity cannot support the number of requests.  They aim to obtain the benefits of both threads (which simplify programming) and events (which lead to constant throughput and lesser latency even when the load increases dramatically).  The design consists of stages, which are the building blocks from which an application can be constructed and consist of an event handler, an incoming event queue, a thread pool, and a controller.  The event handler will process incoming events and assign them to the stage's threads.  The controller may be used to control various performance/throughput tradeoffs.  Controllers also allow for application-specific behavior while still making use of the general SEDA framework (response time controller in Figure 13), thus fulfilling SEDA's goal to be useful for the diverse applications that comprise Internet services.  Applications based on SEDA exhibit high performance while allowing ease of use.  SEDA could be improved by including the use of reinforcement learning to adapt the controllers' behavior to time of day (through learning a policy) or application (through specification of a reward function).  Consider the simple periodic benchmark used for demonstrating the batching controller (Figure 9).  A reinforcement learning-based controller would learn such a distribution and adapt its behavior to follow it.  This could be good, in the case of a workload that had a predictable distribution that followed the time of day; however, for showing that the controller could adapt to arbitrary workloads, you would need a more realistic workload generator.},

The authors adapt many of the algorithms from the ARIES paper.  Stasis also provides additional functionality, such as allowing user-defined operations and providing for LSN estimation to avoid having to store the LSN on each page, which is inconvenient for writing a data object that spans multiple pages.  The paper could have been more effective at supporting its initial claims if it provided a case study of how Stasis's extensible framework with custom operations could be used to better suit an application of the type mentioned in the introduction that motivated the development of such a nonmonolithic data store.

	Annote = {The authors present ARIES, an algorithm for failure recovery in the setting of write-ahead logging (WAL).  Some of the key features of their algorithm are support for partial rollbacks and fine-granularity locking.  The paper fills in some holes in the literature, such as open questions related to fine-granularity locking.  The authors present a set of goals for their system, including simplicity, operation logging, and partial rollbacks.  They mention that some of the goals are in conflict with each other and that they make tradeoffs among the goals; however, they do not spend time providing further explanation of what the conflicts are and what tradeoffs are made.  Given that so many goals were listed, this would have been helpful.  A key emphasis of the paper was in pointing out that some of the previously attempted methods did not handle restart processing correctly with respect to the ordering and implementation of the redo and undo passes.  The authors argue for the ordering of a full redo pass before the undo pass (System R reverses the execution of these passes).  They also mention that many systems perform selective redo (redo only of in-doubt transactions), which is not compatible with WAL.  ARIES instead does full redo, which they refer to as repeating history.  In the conclusion, however, the authors mention that they extended ARIES so that repeating history would be lessened for loser transactions.  This seems to contradict their earlier statements about full redo being of greatest importance.

@article{Wilkes:1996,
	Annote = {Researchers at HP devised and implemented an automatic RAID controller.  It makes use of a two-level storage hierarchy, consisting of mirrored storage and RAID 5 storage.  Based on the current workload, the controller shifts data in block form between the two levels of the hierarchy.  The controller is able to handle diverse workloads.  It can also adapt to changes to the disk array, such as addition/removal of disks.  Thus, a very useful consequence is that it can be used to migrate data from one disk array to another, by adding/removing one disk at a time.  The controller will gradually balance the data over the augmented disk array so that the disk array can eventually be totally replaced without ever having to stop the system running on top of it.

Early in the paper, the authors commented that a major difficulty in array configuration is adapting to diverse workloads.  In their simulation studies, they mentioned that they played back traces collected from various systems.  However, in the conclusion, the authors mentioned that there are some workloads for which their algorithms would not work well.  They could have looked into the features of a workload that would enable high performance and likewise for workloads for which low performance was observed.  More energy looking into the case where performance was poor would give more insight that would help for refining their algorithms, even to the point of adapting to the characteristics of the current workload.},
